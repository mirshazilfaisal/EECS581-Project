## EECS581-Project
# The primary objective of this project is to expose people to how it feels to have Synesthesia.
This condition is unknown to many due to which it is not accepted as a disease and has no
cure. We decided to provide virtual reality for people to hear and see things the way
synesthetes do so that perspective regarding this might change and it might start to get
accepted by others.
